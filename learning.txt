What are views and blueprint in flask

: view function has the code that you write to response to a request
: you create blueprint by combining similar kind of views and register the blueprint with the app instead of every single views separately


Templates: Templates are files that contain static data as well as placeholder for dynamic data. 
    A template is rendered with specific data to produce a final document. Flask uses Jinja 
    template library to render tmeplates.
